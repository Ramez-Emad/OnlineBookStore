# ðŸ“¦ Bulky Web Application

**Bulky** is a complete e-commerce web application built with **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **SQL Server**. The system includes user and role management, product and order management, and Stripe payment integration. It follows a clean, modular **N-Tier Architecture** and applies design patterns like **Repository**, **Unit of Work**, and uses **Redis** for cart management and caching.

## ðŸ§± N-Tier Architecture

This project is structured using **N-Tier Architecture**, ensuring clear separation of concerns:

### 1. Presentation Layer â€“ `BulkyWeb`
- ASP.NET Core MVC frontend
- Razor Views, Controllers, ViewModels
- Areas for modular UI separation: `Admin`, `Customer`, `Identity`
- Custom Middleware for exception handling

### 2. Business Logic Layer (BLL) â€“ `Bulky.BL`
- Business services and logic
- AutoMapper profiles
- Shared DTOs
- Services for each entity and ServiceManager

### 3. Data Access Layer (DAL) â€“ `Bulky.DataAccess`
- Entity Framework Core entities and configuration
- Generic and specific repositories
- Unit of Work pattern for transaction consistency
- Database initializers and migrations

### 4. Utility Layer â€“ `Bulky.Utility`
- Shared components across layers like:
  - `EmailSender.cs` for sending emails
  - `StripeSetting.cs` for payment configuration
